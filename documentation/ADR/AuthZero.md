# Integrating AuthZero for Authentication in a Node.js and Express Application

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our Node.js and Express application requires a robust and scalable user authentication solution. As we aim to provide a secure and seamless user experience, we need a solution that supports various authentication methods, including social logins and multi-factor authentication. Managing security concerns internally has become increasingly complex and resource-intensive.

## Decision
We have decided to integrate Auth0 as our authentication provider. Auth0 offers a wide range of identity management features, which include but are not limited to:

- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Multi-factor authentication
- User management
- Security and compliance features

This decision was made after evaluating several options and considering our application's scalability, security requirements, and the speed of development.

## Consequences
Integrating Auth0 will handle most of the security concerns related to user authentication, allowing our development team to focus on core features. It will also speed up the development process since Auth0 provides out-of-the-box solutions for many common authentication needs. However, this integration binds our application to a third-party service, which involves a dependency that must be managed. Additionally, there will be costs associated with using Auth0's services as we scale.

### Pros
- Enhanced Security: Auth0 provides advanced security features that are continually updated to handle new threats.
- Rapid Development: Reduces the time and effort required to develop complex authentication systems.
- Scalability: Auth0 scales easily with our applicationâ€™s growth, supporting millions of users.
- Compliance: Helps in meeting various compliance requirements like GDPR, HIPAA which can be crucial for expanding the business.

### Cons
- Cost: As user base increases, the cost of using Auth0 can become significant.
- Vendor Lock-in: Reliance on Auth0 could make switching to another provider in the future costly and time-consuming.
- Limited Customization: While Auth0 is highly configurable, extreme customization scenarios might be limited by what is supported by Auth0.
